## <ins> Description of the Task: </ins>

The task that was given was to create a webpage to generate the weather data based on certain criterias set by the user input without encountering any issues.  

## <ins> Description of the Page: </ins>

This page is constructed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript and it features a Javascript program that upon inputting a location name, the user will be given the 5 day forecast for the selected location. The page will also store the five most recent searches for easier access to past searches. Who would this program be suited for? This program is available for interested parties who are looking to see the weather forcast in order to plan ahead depending on future weather conditions. 

## <ins> Remarks: </ins>

- I have added numerous comments along the HTML and Javascript files to annotate what a specific part of the code does.

## <ins> Learning Points: </ins>

- Learned how to utilize the fetch function in order to use 3rd party APIs.
- Learned how to dynamically generate HTML using Javascript.
- Learned how to manipulate the DOM using jQuery.
- Learned how to read errors and debug in the Javascript code using methods such as ***console.log().***
